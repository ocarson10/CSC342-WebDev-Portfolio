# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

Ungrading is a great way to allow students to learn and improve from their mistakes during the semester. I feel that this is a good method that allows students to learn
from teacher feedback and make changes to better their grade rather than being stuck with a bad grade due to lack of experience/knowledge.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I feel that Umgrading will be a great method to learn about the web development process and it will allow me to challenge myself and try new twchnologies throughout the 
semester. Since I have some web development experience, I feel that this method will give me the chance to explore new methods and frameworks while learning the main 
topics discussed in class.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
5; I am very confident that I will be able to earn an A in the class as long as I work to meet the requirments of all assignments and am able to learn from any mistakes
I make throughout the semester.
